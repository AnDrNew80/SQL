If autogrow is enabled for the DB file, the script checks the DB setting for FileMaxSize to be set.
If FileMaxSize is set ñ this is considered the upper limit to threshold against. (unless logical disk size is smaller than FileMaxSize)
If FileMaxSize is NOT set (Unlimited) then the logical disk size is considered the upper limit.

Scenario: Autogrow is NOT enabled: 
If autogrow is not enabled, then the file size is considered the max file size and this value is used for threshold comparison.


In fact, you also need to calculate free disk space:

SELECT  name, size/128  FROM sys.master_files order by 2 desc --size is in 8KB pages 
In SQL Server, the page size is 8-KB. This means SQL Server databases have 128 pages per megabyte
 
 
SELECT DB_NAME(database_id) AS DatabaseName,
Name AS Logical_Name,
Physical_Name, (size*8)/1024 SizeMB
FROM sys.master_files
WHERE DB_NAME(database_id) = 'example'
GO

Ja:
Regarding to your solution:
Is undoubtedly better then Lynx because monitor data file apart of log file as you have mentioned.
But in fact it is only usable when you have limited size of data file (auto growth with maxsize  enabled or auto growth not enabled )   , unless you like shrinking data file very often or truncate tables or you do not have free space on physical disk.

Marek:

Example from our Gemini database (SNOMSK-G31)
Lynx Tablespace script give result = 10291,19 (which is total size after autogrowth)
Our script for table space = Space used 8079,44 (which is actual space used from Total Size ) 

Your script give information about total size (Datas+Logs+Autogrowth)then if u delete / truncate old datas u get space available but for Lynx the size will be still same (because it already grown and lynx will still warning us)!
